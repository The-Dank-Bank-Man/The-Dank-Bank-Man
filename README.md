### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a python script to scrape data from woolworths and compare it to the ABS's CPI measurements.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning C, because I don't know any high level languages yet.
- Iâ€™m willing to collaborate on pretty much anything economics related. 
- My pronouns are he/him.
