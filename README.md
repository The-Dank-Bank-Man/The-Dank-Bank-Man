### Hi there



- Iâ€™m currently working on a python script to scrape data from woolworths and compare it to the ABS's CPI measurements.
- I enjoy contributing to my own projects, because they align best with my interests. However, if you want anyone who knows R, python web scraping and basic C for a simple contribution to an open source project, don't be afraid to contact me. If it's economics related, I'll almost certainly reply back
- Outside of tech, I enjoy debating and participating in theatre
